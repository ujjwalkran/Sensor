# Sensor
This project is aimed at collecting gyroscope and accelerometer data from a mobile device and syncing it to a Firebase database. The same data is streamed to the website in real-time.
The collected data can be used for a wide range of applications such as motion tracking, activity recognition, and fitness monitoring.

# Technologies Used
- Android Studio: to develop the mobile application <br>
- Firebase Realtime Database: to store the collected data <br>
- Java: to write the code for the mobile application <br>
- JavaScript: to write the code for the website <br>
